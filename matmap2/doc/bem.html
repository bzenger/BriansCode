CURRENT STATE OF SOFTWARE
The bem works well for phantom spherical data, however still some significant magnification errors occur when applying it to the
cage data. I suspect it is due to an not exact fitting of the datapoints of the cage in the total geometry. The nodes may be off by
5 or even 10mm. Since the cage is not completely rigid another problem is that the shape of the cage may have altered a little from
experiment to discretisation. The cage was discretisized in two stages, combining the data resulted in the given geometry, but between
both sets already some differences were seen order f a few millimetres. The cage is not a solid entity but consists of two halves that are
put around the heart and they can move a little in respect to eachother. Another concern is the discretisation, the electrodes are folded around
a grid and the node points were taken from the outside, but in fact most electrodes have a contact surface that stretches from inside to outside of
the grid on which the were wound.

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This general function evaluates almost "everyting" for a multilayer sphere
&nbsp;
&nbsp; The potential is evaluate using an expansion in n Legendre polynomials, the current 
&nbsp; density mapping uses a derivative of this expansion in polynomials. The magnetic field is
&nbsp; computed using an analytical expression.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; For the Magnetic field Radius and Sigma need to be supplied although they do not influence the 
&nbsp; outcome, n does not need to be specified either.
&nbsp; The Magnetic field is computed using the Magnetic potential outside the source regions
&nbsp; The solution is therefore only valid outside the volume
&nbsp;
&nbsp; The Current density will only give a valid result inside the modelling space and the potential
&nbsp; will produce valid values everywhere, both inside and outside the volume conductor.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; The Potential and the current density are evaluated using an expansion in Legendre polynomials. 
&nbsp; The more, the more accurate the result will be.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; Choose option 'B' for magnetic field, 'U' for potential and 'J' for current density
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; option     'U', 'B' or 'J'
&nbsp; Pos         Positions [3xM] at which U, J or B needs to be evaluated
&nbsp; DipPos      Position of Dipole needs to be in inner sphere (except for magnetic field)
&nbsp; DipStr      Dipole strength (a vector with three components)
&nbsp; Radius      Radii of the spheres from inside to outside
&nbsp; Sigma       Conductivities in same order
&nbsp; n           Number of Legendre polynomials to evaluate for potential (optional)
&nbsp;             default value for n = 40;
&nbsp;             All vectors are rotate if needed, so do not bother about the format.
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; OUTPUT      
&nbsp; U           The potential U, the current density J or the magnetic field B

&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function checks the integrity of the model matrix
&nbsp; It checks whehter all fields are present, it checks and
&nbsp; corrects the sizes of the fac and pts matrices and it 
&nbsp; checks the triangulation for any inconsistancies.
&nbsp; Although it runs a lot of checks the list is far from complete
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; model       The model that needs checking
&nbsp; mode        'closed' or 'open' default = 'closed'
&nbsp;             Whether the model surfaces are open or closed
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT
&nbsp; model       In case the mistakes could be corrected, this
&nbsp;             matrix contains the corrected fields
&nbsp;
&nbsp; CHECKS:
&nbsp; - Is the surface closed ?
&nbsp; - Is a node used twice in a triangle ?
&nbsp; - Is every triangle oriented the same way ?
&nbsp; - Has the model struct all fields necessairy ?
&nbsp; - Is the surface structure complete ?
&nbsp; - Is the surface CCW or CW ?
&nbsp; - Do the matrices have the correct dimensions ?
&nbsp; - Does the fac matrix contain valid node indices ?
&nbsp;
&nbsp; SOME THINGS THAT ARE NOT CHECKED (YET):
&nbsp; - Do surfaces intersect ?
&nbsp; - Are there surfaces with no surface area (two node coincide, but are properly triangulated) ?
