  DESCRIPTION
  This function generates an activation/recovery map in a new timeseries dataset (TS-structure).
  By specifying the fiducial type, the functtion selects the first fiducialset 
  that meets the description and then puts the map in a new timeseries. In order to produce a map
  the function looks for locally defined % *S "Activation Time" and
  "Reference Time" fiducials. In case these are not available the function
  will fail. The Activation Map 'pot' value is then the difference between
  the Activation Time and Refernece Time. *S % By default the function
  will look for activation fiducials. However specifying another
  type will generate a map of that fiducial.
  When specifying multiple indices, the function puts them all in one timeseries, each frame
  representing an activation map. You can use this functionality to make maps of multiple recordings
  that follow each other chronologically.
 
  INPUT 
  TSindices    the data or Datasets that need integration
  fidtype      the fiducialtype wanted, see FidsType for definitions (activation map by default)
               A string describing the type can be passed as well (see fidsType)
  fidset       only from these sets the map will be generated
               (can be a string specifying the label of the fitset)	
 
  OUTPUT
  TSindexmap   an index to where the map is stored. In case multiple TS series
               were supplied, each integral map is stored in a frame of the output
               The frames are sorted in the way they are supplied in the vector
               The leadinformation is taken from the first TS and the other TSs are
               assumed to be equal to the first one, in respect to the lead ordering
