SCRIPT-files
This directory contains scripts that ease the processing. Since the matlab environment is designed
as a library with a bunch of functions, it does not works like a program. In order to do processing
you can use the scripts defined in this directory. The script are the base for designing a signal-
processing routine, which will do the processing you like. As most jobs require processing a lot of
data sequentially, you should design your own script doing the processing you like. The scripts in 
this directory supply you a framework and show how to access the functionality of the matlab-environment.

New scripts for extending the data acquisition are always welcome. Please use a filename start with
'script' and supply a short description to be included in the automatic documentation on internet.
For the latter purpose you only need to supply a help in the first comment block, the rest will be 
generated automaticly.

&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This is the main entry point into the GUI processing software.
&nbsp; This script will lead you through a couple of steps to do the
&nbsp; basic signal processing, starting from ACQ files and ending up
&nbsp; with tsdf files (timesseries, integration maps and, activation/recovery maps).
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; none (everything is gui based)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT
&nbsp; lots of files hopefully
&nbsp;
&nbsp; DATA FILES:
&nbsp; processingscript.mat  - Last settings used to process some data.
&nbsp; processingdata.mat    - A database with all the settings and selections the
&nbsp;						user made, so reprocessing a file becomes easy!

&nbsp; window. This function is called from ProcessingScript and should not be
&nbsp; used without the GUI of the ProcessingScript.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; none - part of the GUI system

</pre><a name="ref6"></a><br><big><big>scriptActivationMap</big></big><br><br><pre>  FUNCTION scriptActivationMap(filenames,[options])
&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This script helps in creating an activation map. The script will help you select the files which
&nbsp; need to be converted into an activationmap. Subsequently it will extract the activation fiducials
&nbsp; and store them in a new timeseries. In case you have a series of timeseries data that all are part
&nbsp; of the same experiment you can add the activationmaps of each in one frame of the activationmap
&nbsp; data. The activationmap uses the same structure as the timeseries, only now each frame as a time-
&nbsp; series. The newly created map will be saved as a TSDF-file. You will be asked to supply a name for
&nbsp; it. As input you need to specify a TSDFC-file and optional the TSDF-filenames which will be used as
&nbsp; keys. Since the contents of the TSDF-files is ignored they do not necessarily have to be in the same
&nbsp; directory.  
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; filenames     a string with a filename, a cellarray with multiple filenames, or a .files file
&nbsp;               specifying the files you want to use. The filename list must include a tsdfc-file
&nbsp;               or a list of fids-files and of course the tsdf-files you want to process.    
&nbsp; options       addional options for loading such as remapping the leads or frames. In case you want
&nbsp;               to specify options and no filenames, just put an empty array [] in filenames. This
&nbsp;               will ignore this argument
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT	
&nbsp;  -
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OPTIONS
&nbsp; Options can be defined as a structured array with fields specifying the options. Hence an option
&nbsp; is a fieldname and its contents. Default options do not need to be specified (do not include the field)
&nbsp; Here is a list of options you can use (will be extended in future)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; .framemap      specifies which frames you want to read e.g. [1:20] reads the first twenty
&nbsp;                default is all.
&nbsp; .leadmap       specifies which leads you want to read e.g [1 3 5 6 7] reads channels 1,3,5,6,7
&nbsp;                default is all
&nbsp;

</pre><a name="ref7"></a><br><big><big>scriptCalcIntegrals</big></big><br><br><pre>  FUNCTION scriptCalcIntegrals([filenames],[options])
&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This script helps in creating integral maps. The script will help you select the files which
&nbsp; need to be converted into integralmaps. You will be prompted to determine which integrals you
&nbsp; want to compute. Subsequently the fiducials will be retrieved from the timeseries structure to
&nbsp; determine the starting point and the ending point of the integration. Each integral will be 
&nbsp; stored in a new timeseries data structure. If you supply more than one timeseries, the integrals
&nbsp; will be computed for each timeseries you supply. The maps will be sorted by type and all maps of
&nbsp; the same type (say QRST-map) will be put in one file. So when processing an experiment consisting 
&nbsp; of multiple measurements in a row, the map will have all subsequent maps in one files.
&nbsp; The script will ask you for filenames, please supply a TSDF-filename(s) and a TSDFC-filename.
&nbsp; After computing the maps, you will be asked to supply a name for the integralmaps. An extension
&nbsp; will be added to this name, determing the type of integral. You do not need to worry about this
&nbsp; extension, it will be added automaticly. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; filenames     a string with a filename, a cellarray with multiple filenames, or a .files file
&nbsp;               specifying the files you want to use. The filename list must include a tsdfc-file
&nbsp;               or a list of fids-files and of course the tsdf-files you want to process.    
&nbsp; options       addional options for loading such as remapping the leads or frames. In case you want
&nbsp;               to specify options and no filenames, just put an empty array [] in filenames. This
&nbsp;               will ignore this argument
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT	
&nbsp;  -
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OPTIONS
&nbsp; Options can be defined as a structured array with fields specifying the options. Hence an option
&nbsp; is a fieldname and its contents. Default options do not need to be specified (do not include the field)
&nbsp; Here is a list of options you can use (will be extended in future)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; .framemap      specifies which frames you want to read e.g. [1:20] reads the first twenty
&nbsp;                default is all.
&nbsp; .leadmap       specifies which leads you want to read e.g [1 3 5 6 7] reads channels 1,3,5,6,7
&nbsp;                default is all
&nbsp;
&nbsp; EXAMPLES
&nbsp;
&nbsp; >> scriptCalcIntegrals
&nbsp; This will ask you for the filenames in the program and uses default options
&nbsp;
&nbsp; >> options.leadmap = [1:128]
&nbsp; >> scriptCalcIntegrals(options)
&nbsp; This will do the script only for the first 128 leads in the files, of course this option can be
&nbsp; specified through the menu as well.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; test.files contains:
&nbsp;  tsdffile1.tsdf
&nbsp;  tsdffile2.tsdf
&nbsp;  tsdfcontainer.tsdfc
&nbsp;  tsdffile3.tsdf
&nbsp;
&nbsp; >> scriptCalcIntegrals('test.files')
&nbsp; This will load the three tsdf-files and assumes tsdfcontainer to have the fiducials

&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function does the laplacian interpolation scheme for a series of
&nbsp; tsdf files.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; tsdflabel    The label of the tsdf files (label is filename without -number)
&nbsp; tsdfnumbers  The numbers of the files you want to process
&nbsp; .geomfiles   The .geom/.fac/.pts/.channels files that describe the
&nbsp;              geometry. This input cab be spread over multiple inputs
&nbsp; badleads     The badlads you want to interpolate
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT
&nbsp;              Tries to overwrite old files with the newly interpolate ones

</pre><a name="ref10"></a><br><big><big>subscriptRemapping</big></big><br><br><pre>  FUNCTION options = subscriptRemapping(options)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function is a piece of a complete script which helps you setup some 
&nbsp; remapping parameters such as a leadmap or framemap. It also lets you load
&nbsp; channels/mapping files to remap the channels for more convenient displaying
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; options      The options array in which the remapping options have to be translated
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT
&nbsp; options      The same options array only now with a field leadmap or framemap
&nbsp;
&nbsp; NOTE
&nbsp; You can put this subscript in your script if you want to allow remapping.
&nbsp; You can supply the options array to ioReadTS, which will do the remapping for you
&nbsp; upon loading the files. Or supply the options array to tsRemap, which will remap
&nbsp; a set of timeseries in memory. Both functions accept the mapping options specified
&nbsp; by this subscript.
