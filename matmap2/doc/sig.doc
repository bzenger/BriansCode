  DESCRIPTION
  Do the baseline correction. This function needs two points being the
  points where the signal should be electrically silent. Additional a
  window can be specified that specifies the number of points at each
  position to be taken for the baseline correction, so a noise has a less
  dramtaic effect on this correction. In case of the window the positions
  defined in baselinepoints indicate the start of the window and basline-
  window determines the length of the window. The baseline correction is 
  done by a linear least squares fit of the points in both windows,
  subsequently the base line curve is subtracted from the data.
 
  INPUT
  TSindices     The indices into the TS array of all Timeseries that need
                a baseline correction.
  
  baselinepoints A vector of two points indicating the position of each
                baseline fiducial
  baselinewindow The number of points to take for each fiducial (default = 1)
  
  OUTPUT
  Corrected signals are written back into the TS structure

  DESCRIPTION
  This function generates a calibration file.
 
  INPUT
  acqfilename    Name of the ACQ file that contains the 1mV or 10mV dataset
  mappingfile    Name of the mapping file used to map the acq-file
  '1mV'          To indicate it is a 1mV file
  '10mV'         To indicate it is a 10mV file (you always need to specify one of both)
  channels       To tell which channels should be used in the calibration the other channels are 
                 ignored. This option is for multiple acq-file so you can specify which channel
                 is calibrated with which file
  acqfilename2   After the first input you can enter a second couple of acqfilenames, '1mv'/'10mv', mapping file and
                 channel description to complete the cal file. Even three or more entries are allowed
  outputfilename Name for a file in which the cals are stored
 
  OUTPUT
  cal            A vector containing the calibration values (scalars for multiplying the signal strengths).

  EXAMPLE
  >> tank = [1:192]
  >> cage = [193:802];
  >> cal =  sigCalibrate('10mvcal.acq','10mV',tank,'torsopluscage.mapping','1mvcal.acq','1mV',torso,'mycals.cal');
  This calibrates the signals based on two files the vectors tank and cage indicate which channels
  to take from each one. The mapping file is only specified once as it is equal for both files.
  The last argument saves the calibrations in the file mycals.cal. This input is not required, you can use
  ioWriteCal as well.

  DESCRIPTION
  This function generates a calibration file.
 
  INPUT
  acqfilename    Name of the ACQ file that contains the 1mV or 10mV dataset
  mappingfile    Name of the mapping file used to map the acq-file
  cal8filename   Name for a file in which the cals are stored
 
  OUTPUT
  cal            A vector containing the calibration values (scalars for multiplying the signal strengths).

  OR       TSdata = sigDetectPacing(TSdata,pacinglead)
 
  DESCRIPTION
  This function detects the pacing stimulus in a channel recording this
  stimulus. It converts all simuli into fiducials and adds that to the 
  datastructure. A field pacing is created as well containing pacing
  timeintervals (.pacing).
 
  INPUT
  TSindex     index into the TS array
  TSdata      a struct or cell array containing the timeseries data
  pacinglead  number of the lead on which the pacing is recorded
 
  OUTPUT
  TSdata      a struct or cell array containing the timeseries data

           [newTSindices] = tsSliceTS(TSindices,[fstart:fend])
           newdata = tsSliceTS(data,fstart,fend) 
           newdata = tsSliceTS(data,[fstart:fend]) 
 
  DESCRIPTION
  This function takes a subset of the slices from the data. In works in various modes: 1)
  supplying indices in the TS array will do the operation in the TS array, 2) if you request
  an output argument new entries will be made in the TS array with the sliced data, 3) You can
  supply the timeseries data directly and get back the data directly. 
 
  INPUT
  TSindices/data   You can provide the data directly or as indices of the TS array
  fstart           Frame to start with
  fend             Frame to end with
 
  OUTPUT 
  newTSindices     In case there is an output argument a new data set will be created
                   with the sliced data, otherwise the original TS series will be sliced
  newdata          In case of providing the data directly the sliced data will be put on
                   the output
