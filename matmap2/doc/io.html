&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function reads the pointers to the TSDFC-files which are stored in the DFC-files. If DFC files are nested multiple
&nbsp; files are read until the level where everything is a TSDFC-file. This function will return the TSDFC entries found in 
&nbsp; a DFC-file. The function differs from ioReadTSDFCFiles in that respect that it returns TSDFC-files and NOT TSDF-files. 
&nbsp; This function was designed to support the reading of DFC-files as if they are arrays of TSDFC-files. Hence it is used 
&nbsp; in preparsing the TSDFC/DFC-file arrays to consist only of TSDFC-files. In the reading process DFC-files are interpreted
&nbsp; as being an array of TSDFC-files.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function loads a mapping/channels file. A mapping file is directly loaded
&nbsp; into memory as it specifies where each channel should be located. A channels file
&nbsp; is translated to be in the same format of the mapping file if possible. The
&nbsp; structure of the latter file is different and thence needs a small conversion to
&nbsp; act as a remapping file. In a mapping file each subsequent lead in the resulting 
&nbsp; data matrix is assigned a new set of data whereas for a channels file this is not
&nbsp; necessarily true. Hence in the latter case zeros are put in between.
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; filename		name of the file (wildcards allowed)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT
&nbsp; map			a vector specifying which channels should be mapped to position one,two
&nbsp;                       etc. map(1) is the new lead/frame at position one, map(2) for position two

&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; filename      name of the pts-file
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT

</pre><a name="ref20"></a><br><big><big>ioReadTS</big></big><br><br><pre>  FUNCTION TSindices = ioReadTS(filenames,[indexvector],[options])
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; filenames      An cellarray of strings or a string specifying the files to be loaded. The function requires
&nbsp;                that you specify the filename complete with extension. The use of wildcards in the filenames
&nbsp;                is allowed. The filenames can be contained in one or more input arguments. The order of the
&nbsp;                filenames determines the order in which they are read.
&nbsp;                Files loaded include .tsdf/.data/.acq/.tsdfc./dfc./.fids/.mapping/.cal/.cal8
&nbsp;                Warning do not mix .acq and .tsdf it may lead to some unpredicted effects
&nbsp;                Specifying a TSDFC-file without any TSDF-files will load the complete list contained in the
&nbsp;                TSDFC-file.
&nbsp;                Specifying a TSDF-file in combination with a TSDFC-file, will use the TSDFC-files to lookup
&nbsp;                the data specified for the timeseries in the TSDF-files. Instead of a TSDFC-file a DFC file
&nbsp;                can be specified as well. The latter is considered to be an array TSDFC-files. If multiple
&nbsp;                entries are found in the collection of TSDFC-files multiple versions of the TSDF-file are 
&nbsp;                loaded. 
&nbsp;                Specifying a GEOM-file or a combination of FAC/PTS/CHANNELS-files will add the geometry to the
&nbsp;                loaded data. The geometry will be linked to the TS-data in the geom field which has a pointer
&nbsp;                to geometries specified in GEOM. In order to specify geometries keep up with the following rules
&nbsp;                specify the geometry files in the following order channels-file followed by a geom or fac file.
&nbsp;                The latter may be accompanied by pts file as well. The program will keep this search order and
&nbsp;                groups the geometry files in that order.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; indexvector    Specifies which and in which order the timeseries have to be loaded. Assuming the input file
&nbsp;                series to be number 1 to n. The indexvector tells the function which of those to actually load.
&nbsp;                Use this function to specify the timeseries in a TSDFC-file or for a TSDF-file with multiple
&nbsp;                entries. The timeseries are read first scanning the first string array or string then passing to
&nbsp;                the next argument and scanning through them etc. Use ioScanTS to get an overview of the timeseries
&nbsp;                specified.
&nbsp; options        See options section
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT
&nbsp; TSindices      The indices to the TS-cell array where the files have been loaded.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; NOTE FOR ACQ FILES
&nbsp;                Calibration and mapping is done while loading of the acq-data. Specify a .mapping and a .cal/.cal8
&nbsp;                file as input parameters for calibration and mapping of the data. Use sigCalibrate8 to create a
&nbsp;                calibration file.    
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OPTIONS
&nbsp; Options can be defined as a structured array with fields specifying the options. Hence an option
&nbsp; is a fieldname and its contents. Default options do not need to be specified (do not include the field)
&nbsp; Here is a list of options you can use (will be extended in future)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; .framemap      Specifies which frames you want to read e.g. [1:20] reads the first twenty
&nbsp;                The default setting is all frames.
&nbsp; .leadmap       Specifies which leads you want to read e.g [1 3 5 6 7] reads channels 1,3,5,6,7
&nbsp;                the default setting is all leads.
&nbsp; .skiptsdffile  Specifies that you do not want to load the TSDF-files and it will only load the data from
&nbsp;                the TSDFC-files. This function is turned off default. Just assign it to be one to turn it on.
&nbsp; .scantsdffile  Specifies that you only want to scan the TSDF-files. This will load details like the label and
&nbsp;                auditstrings, number of channels and number of leads but not the data itself.
&nbsp;                This function is turned off default. Just assign it to be one to turn it on.
&nbsp; .readtsdffids  Read the global fiducials stored in the TSDF-files as well. If this options is turned on, you 
&nbsp;                cannot skip reading a TSDF-file. Turn this one by setting it to one.
&nbsp; .timeseries    Another way of specifying which timeseries to load from a TSDF-file. This will apply to all the
&nbsp;                files you supply. This array contains the number of timeseries you want to load.
&nbsp; .scalemap      For ACQ files only. This options specifies the scaling of each map. Basicly each channel is multiplied
&nbsp;                by this value. The scalemap has to be the same size as the number of channels or th e leadmap
&nbsp;                In case of a leadmap specify the scalemap values in the same order as the leadmap (the way it is done
&nbsp;                in a .cals file)

&nbsp; REMARK
&nbsp; This function is a copy of ioReadTS but does not load the data in the TS structure but returns a cell array
&nbsp; directly.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; filenames      An cellarray of strings or a string specifying the files to be loaded. The function requires
&nbsp;                that you specify the filename complete with extension. The use of wildcards in the filenames
&nbsp;                is allowed. The filenames can be contained in one or more input arguments. The order of the
&nbsp;                filenames determines the order in which they are read.
&nbsp;                Files loaded include .tsdf/.tsdfc./dfc/.fids/.acq/.mapping/.cal/.cal8 
&nbsp;                Specifying a TSDFC-file without any TSDF-files will load the complete list contained in the
&nbsp;                TSDFC-file.
&nbsp;                Specifying a TSDF-file in combination with a TSDFC-file, will use the TSDFC-files to lookup
&nbsp;                the data specified for the timeseries in the TSDF-files. Instead of a TSDFC-file a DFC file
&nbsp;                can be specified as well. The latter is considered to be an array TSDFC-files. If multiple
&nbsp;                entries are found in the collection of TSDFC-files multiple versions of the TSDF-file are 
&nbsp;                loaded. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp; indexvector    Specifies which and in which order the timeseries have to be loaded. Assuming the input file
&nbsp;                series to be number 1 to n. The indexvector tells the function which of those to actually load.
&nbsp;                Use this function to specify the timeseries in a TSDFC-file or for a TSDF-file with multiple
&nbsp;                entries. The timeseries are read first scanning the first string array or string then passing to
&nbsp;                the next argument and scanning through them etc. Use ioScanTS to get an overview of the timeseries
&nbsp;                specified.
&nbsp; options        See options section
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OUTPUT
&nbsp; data           A cell array with the data contained in the files.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; OPTIONS
&nbsp; Options can be defined as a structured array with fields specifying the options. Hence an option
&nbsp; is a fieldname and its contents. Default options do not need to be specified (do not include the field)
&nbsp; Here is a list of options you can use (will be extended in future)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; .framemap      Specifies which frames you want to read e.g. [1:20] reads the first twenty
&nbsp;                The default setting is all frames.
&nbsp; .leadmap       Specifies which leads you want to read e.g [1 3 5 6 7] reads channels 1,3,5,6,7
&nbsp;                the default setting is all leads.
&nbsp; .skiptsdffile  Specifies that you do not want to load the TSDF-files and it will only load the data from
&nbsp;                the TSDFC-files. This function is turned off default. Just assign it to be one to turn it on.
&nbsp; .scantsdffile  Specifies that you only want to scan the TSDF-files. This will load details like the label and
&nbsp;                auditstrings, number of channels and number of leads but not the data itself.
&nbsp;                This function is turned off default. Just assign it to be one to turn it on.
&nbsp; .readtsdffids  Read the global fiducials stored in the TSDF-files as well. If this options is turned on, you 
&nbsp;                cannot skip reading a TSDF-file. Turn this one by setting it to one.
&nbsp; .timeseries    Another way of specifying which timeseries to load from a TSDF-file. This will apply to all the
&nbsp;                files you supply. This array contains the number of timeseries you want to load.
&nbsp; .scalemap      Adds a scalingmap for a ACQ file. A values are multiplied my the data in this vector
&nbsp;                The vector should have the same size as the number of leads.

&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp;  This function writes TSDF and TSDFC-files 
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; filenames      An cellarray of strings or a string specifying the files to be loaded. The function requires
&nbsp;                that you specify the filename complete with extension. The use of wildcards in the filenames
&nbsp;                is allowed. The filenames can be contained in one or more input arguments. The order of the
&nbsp;                filenames determines the order in which they are written.
&nbsp;                Files that can be written are .tsdfc and .tsdf.
&nbsp;                If you want to write the geometry files (.geom/.fac/.pts/.channels) use ioWriteGeom. 
&nbsp;                1) Specifying a TSDFC-file without any TSDF-files will try to store each timeseries in a new file.
&nbsp;                The newfile name will be the filename with the newfileext attached to it.
&nbsp;              	 If the field newfileext is empty  a statement '_copy' will be added. In this way no source tsdf
&nbsp;                file will be overwriten. If you want to determine the filename completely, delete the field
&nbsp;                filename and put the new filename in newfileext. This way you control the filenames.
&nbsp;                However if the new file already exists the function will not allow you to overwrite any tsdf
&nbsp;                file. In order to unlock this savety feature, state 'overwrite' at the end of the statement.
&nbsp;                This will cause the function to prompt for each file you are about to overwrite  
&nbsp;                2) Specifying a series of TSDF-filenames will overrule the standard generated names and saves
&nbsp;                your files with these names. Be sure to put 'overwrite' if you want to be able to overwrite 
&nbsp;                existing files and take care that the list of tsdf filenames equals the dimension of TSindices.	
&nbsp;                3) if you want multiple timeseries in one file, use ioWriteTSDF instead. This function will not
&nbsp;                allow more than one timeseries per file. 		 
&nbsp;             	 Note if you want to write fiducials you have to supply a tsdfcfilename. Ohterwise no fiducials will

&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function reads the fiducials from a TSDFC-file and
&nbsp; from FIDS-files. Even fiducials stored within a TSDF-file are
&nbsp; processed. The fiducials from external files are read and stored
&nbsp; in the fids/fidset fields. All the fields will be renumber properly.

&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function reads one TSDF file into the TS-structure. The function is based on
&nbsp; mexReadTSDF, but has some additional functionality, for instance it adds data on where
&nbsp; the data originated from, so when using ioWriteTSDF it knows what filenames to use by
&nbsp; default. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function reads the file-pointers contained in a TSDFC-file or a DFC-file. The function
&nbsp; returns the filenames in the order of the TSDFC-files. Within a TSDFC-file the keys are
&nbsp; alphabetically sorted by the function. If a DFC-file is supplied this file will be translated into 
&nbsp; TSDFC-filenames first and subsequently they will be processed as an array of TSDFC-files.
&nbsp; The function is intented to get all the TSDF-filenames to be loaded. Since the default option
&nbsp; of ioReadTS in case no TSDF-filename is supplied is to read them all, this function is called

&nbsp; INTERNAL FUNCTION
&nbsp; Avoid using this function, as it might change in the future

&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function reads one TSDF file into a structure (not the TS-structure). The function is based on
&nbsp; mexReadTSDF, but has some additional functionality, for instance it adds data on where
&nbsp; the data originated from, so when using ioWriteTSDF it knows what filenames to use by

&nbsp;
&nbsp; INTERNAL FUNCTION
&nbsp;
&nbsp; DESCRIPTION
&nbsp; This function checks the integrity of the fiducials.
&nbsp; Only allowing global (length=1) or local fiducial (length=numleads)
&nbsp; On other configurations the function will fail. As well remapping 
&nbsp; options are build in and the fiducials will be corrected for this.
&nbsp; In case no TSDF-data is loaded, the function will check whether only 
&nbsp; two lengths of fiducias are present, assuming local fiducials to
&nbsp; have a length other than one, but all need to be the same as they 
&nbsp; correspond to the same dataset.
&nbsp; In case of frame renumbering the fiducials will be checked. Any fiducials
&nbsp; that are out of range will be removed as integrals based on them will not
&nbsp; be valid. The latter check is only performed in case a number of frames is
&nbsp; specified, so you will be allowed to load fidsets only
&nbsp;
&nbsp; INPUT
&nbsp; TSindex     The indices of the timeseries to be inspected
