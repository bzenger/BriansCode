README.txt / SCRIPT directory

SCRIPT-files
This directory contains scripts that ease the processing. Since the matlab environment is designed
as a library with a bunch of functions, it does not works like a program. In order to do processing
you can use the scripts defined in this directory. The script are the base for designing a signal-
processing routine, which will do the processing you like. As most jobs require processing a lot of
data sequentially, you should design your own script doing the processing you like. The scripts in 
this directory supply you a framework and show how to access the functionality of the matlab-environment.

New scripts for extending the data acquisition are always welcome. Please use a filename start with
'script' and supply a short description to be included in the automatic documentation on internet.
For the latter purpose you only need to supply a help in the first comment block, the rest will be 
generated automaticly.
