README - file - Jeroen - 2002   

This directory contains files for displaying messages to the user.

Since we want the matlab environment for data processing to be both
accessible from a script as well as a user interface, you want
error messages sometimes to popup and sometimes to be just listed in a
log-file or at the command prompt. To build this functionality within 
each function is pointless, hence a couple of functions dealing with 
this aspect are present in this directory.
