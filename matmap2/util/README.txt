UTIL directory

This directory contains a set of function that help the user guide the input and output in scripts.
The functions in this directory are meant to ease supplying filenames, selecting options and creating
new filenames. At the moment most functions in this directory are concerned with supplying filenames
from a by user supplied list and asking simple questions to the user.
Of course, other general utilities are welcomed as well.
