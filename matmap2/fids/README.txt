NOTES ON FIDS/FIDSET-structure and functions

In this directory all functions are stored for manipulating the fids and fidset structures in the
TS (timeseries) data. The data is stored in this array differs in a few ways from the data stored
in the container files and in Everett. In Everett all fiducials are grouped into sets called fidsets.
These fidsets contain all the fiducials themselves. In the matlab implementation, a different approach
is chosen: all fiducials are put in one array. In order to be compatible and to be able to write back
the fiducicals to a TSDFC-file, for each fiducial an index in the fidset cellarray is stored. This
array merely stores the information on where a fiducial came from. Both fiducial set labels and audit
strings are stored here. The audit strings are not updated by the programs. In addition fiducials
deriving from TSDF or FIDS-files are stored in these arrays as well, they are stored in a new fidset.
The reason for putting everything on one heap is that it allows for easier searching for fiducials.

Fiducials have a type associated as well, this type is stored for each individual fiducial in the array.
The fidtype consists of a number that is compatible with Everett. However to ease the use, you can put
a description of the fiducial in functions wanting a type. This fiducialname is translated using fidsType.
See in the help of fidsType for all names supported. The list can be extended on demand and is hardcoded
into the matlab code.

New fiducials can be created in the list. If you leave the fidset field at zero a new fidset will be 
created for all the fiducials not in a fidset. This one will be marked as being generated by matlab
and be compatible with Everett. Feel free to define your own fidset, normally only the label and audit
(string) will be used for writing back in a new tsdfc-entry. Leaving empty spots in the fidset array
does not harm the writeback process. If a fidset entry is empty and it is referred to, a new fidset
will be created. (A statement will be supplied in the auditstring of the conversion proces).

Both local and global fiducials are allowed. Take care that local fiducials should have the same number of
channels as the data. Upon loading the fiducials they will be checked for this property and invalid sets 
will be discarded upon loading.
