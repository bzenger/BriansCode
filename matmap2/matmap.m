function MatMap(varargin)

% FUNCTION matmap(['nomsg'],['pathonly'],['keepglobal'])
%
% DESCRIPTION
%  This function launches the matlab environment for processing time series and maps
%  The function carries no input or output as it just initialises some of the windows 
%  the program environment can be programmed and adjusted using the windows that will
%  be launched.
%
%  OPTIONS
%   'nomsg'         Do not display the welcome message
%   'keepglobal'    Do not clear the globals
%   'pathonly'      Do only the path settings
%
% SEE ALSO -

% This function carries out a few jobs
% - Firstly it initiates the path environment
%   so all functions can be found. All the subdirectories 
%   of the main directory will be added.
% - Secondly the central globals will be initiated

% Changes removed global SETTINGS, I am not using it

function ShowStartupMSG

   % Just display the startup.doc contents

function AddPaths

   % Function adds paths to search tree of matlab

   % Who am I ? Since I have not decided on a nice acronym yet
   % keep the programming name independent. Just renaming this file
   % should do the trick

   FullProgramName = which(mfilename); % Try to find my location

   % The file runs ergo the file must exist

   [ProgramPath,ProgramName,Ext] = fileparts(FullProgramName);

   % Put this info up there for every one to use

   global Program
   Program.Name = ProgramName;
   Program.Path = ProgramPath;

   % Now add all subdirectories of this directory to the pathlist

   Dir = dir(ProgramPath);

   for p = 1:length(Dir),
      if Dir(p).isdir == 1,
         % Since matlab does not add a path twice we do not need to worry about that
         addpath(fullfile(ProgramPath,Dir(p).name,'')); % Do it properly so it will work on both unix as Windoos
      end
   end

   % The program should run this way, keeping the current path as it is
   % In case somebody wants to run it from the data directory
   % Having a matlab path to the central directory is hence enough to start the program
